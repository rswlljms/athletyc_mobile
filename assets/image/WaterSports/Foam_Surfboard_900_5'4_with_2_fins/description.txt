A short surfboard to try out all the tricks, even in places you would be scared of hurting yourself with a rigid board. Developed in our design centre in Hendaye on the Basque coast.

Designed by our team of surfing enthusiasts for competent surfers looking to surf the shorebreak or in weak waves without getting hurt.
